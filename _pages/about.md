Hello there! My name is Kevin, and I am a software engineer and DevOps professional with a passion for automation and cloud technology. I am also a digital nomad that loves slowly traveling the works and exploring new places and cultures.

In my free time, I engage in a few hobbies that help me stay centered and balanced. I am an avid fan of Baduk, the ancient Asian game of strategy and tactics, and I find a sense of serenity while scuba diving among coral reefs. I also have a deep interest in economics and strive to stay informed of the latest developments and trends in Bitcoin.

I created this blog to motivate myself to write and share my experiences and perspectives on technology, travel, Bitcoin, and anything else I find interesting with like-minded individuals. I aim to inspire others to pursue their passions and live fulfilling lives.

Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you will find my posts informative and inspiring. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to contact me.
