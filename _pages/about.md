Hello there! My name is Kevin and I am a software engineer and DevOps professional with a passion for automation and cloud technology. As a digital nomad, I have the unique opportunity to explore new cultures while slowly traveling the world.

In my free time, I engage in a few hobbies that help me stay centered and balanced. I am an avid fan of Baduk, the ancient Asian game of strategy and tactics, and find a sense of serenity while scuba diving among coral reefs. I also have a deep interest in economics and strive to stay informed of the latest developments and trends in the world of Bitcoin.

I created this blog as a platform to share my knowledge, experiences, and perspectives on technology, personal development, travel, and Bitcoin with like-minded individuals. My goal is to inspire others to pursue their passions and live a fulfilling life.

Thank you for visiting my blog and I hope you will find my posts informative and inspiring. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
